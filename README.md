# Handwritten-digit-recognisation 
The main objective of this project is to create a model that allows
effective recognition of handwritten digits. In
any recognition process, the important problem is to address
the feature extraction and correct classification approaches. The
algorithm tries to address both the factors and well in terms of
accuracy and time complexity. The overall highest accuracy
94.91% is achieved in the recognition process. 

Before running, please import tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib or run the project on google collab.
